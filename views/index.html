            <p>Hey there, lil' buddy, it looks like you found my page! This is just a little project so you can see some of
                the stuff I am capable of creating.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>It all began in 2000.</h3>
            <p>I was born in 2000 to an American father and a Russian mother. I have lived in the same home for all my life,
                near Smyrna and Vinings. I am a senior at The Lovett School, a school which I credit with my programming
                abilities.
            </p>
            <p>I am also an alumnus of The Outdoor Academy, a semester school based in Brevard, NC. My experiences there are
                primarily responsible for shaping the man I am today.</p>
